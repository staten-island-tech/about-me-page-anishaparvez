     <p>Hi My name is Anisha Parvez and I am a Junior at Tech. I enjoy playing the piano, running and dancing.I am ambitious to learn something new always even if it may seem challenging at first I am willing to take on challenges. My goal for computer science is to improve my skills and gain more knowledge in computer science so when this class is over I will be able to take on these skills later on.  have alittle brother who is 8 years old and I like spending time with him. I like teaching children because they are always so curious and are willing to know more things. This summer I interned at an Interior design firm where I used my cad skills to make designs. This year I am most interested in my ap computer science class and ap biology class. </p>
